; PVE clusters should to be specified as follows.
;
;   [pve:CLUSTER_ALIAS]
;   ; The API must be reachable over HTTPS. The USER needs PVEVMAdmin
;   ; powers on '/' in your PVE cluster.
;   api=https://USER@pve:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT
;
; The PVE clusters have one or more storage devices that must be
; reachable over SSH. When moving data between storage devices, the
; data is first copied to the `temp` location on the destination storage
; and then converted to the correct format.
;
; Every cluster needs at least one storage device. Some may be shared
; across nodes, others exist on a single node only.
;
; If the path is a plain path, file-based images are used. If the path
; equals with "/dev/pve", it is considered to be a local-lvm (LvmThin)
; logical volumes are used. If the path starts with "zfs:", it is
; considered to be a zfs filesystem path.
;
;     [storage:CLUSTER_ALIAS:DISK_NAME[@NODE_NAME]]
;     ssh=root@HOST
;     path=/path/to/somewhere   ; for plain disk (DISK_NAME:VMID/...), or
;     path=zfs:ZFS_FS_NAME      ; for ZFS (DISK_NAME:vm-VMID-disk-1)

; Example cluster named "banana-cluster" with 4 storage devices, one
; shared, and two which exist on a single node only.
